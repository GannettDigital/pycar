# write a function to do some exploring with integers

    # open the csv

    # create the object that represents the data in the csv file

    # create a variable to represent the header row

    # let's get the first row of data

    # let's create a varaible off the bat to isolate
    # the integer that is the zip code

    # let's output the value

    # let's get the length of the integer

    # for kicks let's multiply zipcode by 2. we should get 68592

    # let's make sure this is an integer
    # because its not an integer, when we tried to double it, python simply repeated the string

    # let's convert the string to an integer

    # now let's try some math

    # multiplication

    # division

    # addition

    # subtraction

    # order of operations

    # close the csv file when we're done
