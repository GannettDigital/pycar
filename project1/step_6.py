# write a function to do some more exploring with strings

    # open the csv

    # create the object that represents the data in the csv file

    # create a variable to represent the header row

    # from the last lesson we know the variable header_row refers to a list
    # let's isolate the string that is 'Acquiring Institution'

    # create a variable to hold our string

    # let's evaluate the uppercase version is equal to the lowercase version

    # let's remove the space that is present in the string

    # let's change the space to an underscore

    # let's look at the strip method by giving it a value

    # let's look at what the strip method does to the ouput of above

    # let's try to split the string on the space

    # let's get the datatype for the thing we just created
    # first lets create a variable to hold this string

    # then let's get the type

    # because it's a list, we can again get a specfic item by it's index
    # and we're back to where we started

    # for the final item let's use the length of the list and lowercase the two strings we created to create a sentence

    # close the csv file when we're done
