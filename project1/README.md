### 9:30 - 10:30 a.m.

**Project #1**

* Start with a CSV.
    * [FDIC Failed Bank list](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html) is always good?
* What do we want to do with it?
    * Let's write some basic scripts to see what we're working with.
    * Then we'll introduce some key Python types like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.
    * After the white board, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through together writing in Python code, running the file at the command line.
    * We'll hold your hand through it, step by step. (Only at the end of the day will we give you the full working version, so there's no cheating!)

**The files**

```step_1.py/my_step_1.py```

* Open the csv file & log the csv object that is returned.

```step_2.py/my_step_2.py```

* Let's log the number of rows in the file.

```step_3.py/my_step_3.py```

* Let's use a FOR loop to log each row, noting the data type & the contents.

```step_4.py/my_step_4.py```

* Let's get the header row, learn about list indexes and strings and getting lengths.

```step_5.py/my_step_5.py```

* Let's use the header row to isolate a string and learn more about things we can do with strings
    * get its type
    * get its length
    * capitalize it
    * lowercase it
    * uppercase it

```step_6.py/my_step_6.py```

* Let's keep using the header row to learn more things that we can do with strings
    * get a specfic item from a list by it's index
    * evaluate values
    * remove a character between two words
    * change a character to an underscore
    * strip whitespace
    * split two words on a character
    * get its type
    * use the length of the list and lowercase the two strings we created to create a sentence

```step_7.py/my_step_7.py```

* Let's use the header row to isolate the zip code and convert it to an integer so we can do some math
    * multiplication
    * division
    * addition
    * subtraction
    * order of operations
