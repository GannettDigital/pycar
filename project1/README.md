**Project #1**

* What is a [number](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers)? What is a [string](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#strings)? What is a [list](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)? Nevermind that, what's a [Python](https://docs.python.org/2.7/)?

    * Python is a programming language. It was created around 1991 by an individual named Guido van Rossum.

    * You may hear Python called a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language). You may also hear it called an interpretative language. In essence these are interchangeable terms.

        * In Python you write programs that are interpreted line by line. These programs - or scripts - automate tasks that would otherwise be completed one by one.

    * One feature of Python that takes some getting used to is its use whitespace and indentation to separate lines of a program. More on this later.

    * The Python interpreter can be accessed through the command line (terminal, shell, etc). On a Unix-based (Mac OS) or Linux machine - which come with Python installed by default - you enter the Python interpreter by typing ```python``` followed by the return key. On a Windows machine, things are a bit more cumbersome.

    * Let's start by looking at some key components of any programming language - variables, strings, numbers and comparisons. We'll consider Python lists which can be used to store information and we'll work toward using a couple core libraries - ```urllib``` and ```csv```  - to download a csv file and read the contents.

**The files**

* ```step_1.py``` and ```step_1_complete.py```

    * Variables
    * Numbers
    * Strings

* ```step_2.py``` and ```my_step_2.py```

    * Let's do some math
        * multiplication
        * division
        * addition
        * subtraction
        * order of operations

    * Let's learn more about things we can do with strings
        * capitalize it
        * lowercase it
        * uppercase it
        * We can try to get its length

* ```step_3.py``` and ```my_step_3.py```

    * How can we determine which variable is a number and which is a string?
    * How can we evaluate values of a variable?

* ```step_4.py``` and ```my_step_4.py```

    * Let's jump into downloading a csv file, opening it, looping through each row and printing the data

* ```step_5.py``` and ```my_step_5.py```

    * Let's use a row of data to learn how to
        * get a specfic item from a list by it's index
        * remove a character between two words
        * change a character to an underscore
        * strip whitespace
        * split two words on a character
