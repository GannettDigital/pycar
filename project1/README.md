### 9:30 - 10:30 a.m.

**Project #1**

* Start with a CSV.
    * [FDIC Failed Bank list](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html) is always good?
* What do we want to do with it? Let's white board it.
    * Start with parsing and processing exercise, introducing key Python types and concepts, like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.
    * After the white board, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through together writing in Python code, running the file at the command line.
    * We'll hold your hand through it, step by step. (Only at the end of the day will we give you the full working version, so there's no cheating!)

**The files**

* **step_1.py**:
    * Open the csv file & log the csv object that is returned.

* **step_2.py**:
    * Let's log the number of rows in the file.

* **step_3.py**:
    * Let's use a FOR loop to log each row, noting the data type & the contents.

* **step_4.py**:
    * Let's get the header row and learn about list index and strings.
