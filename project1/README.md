9:30 - 10:30 a.m. 
Project #1
Start with a CSV. What do we want to do with it?
Let's white board it.
Start with parsing and processing exercise, introducing key Python types and concepts, like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.

After the white board, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through together writing in Python code, running the file at the command line.
We'll hold your hand through it, step by step. (Only at the end of the day will we give you the full working version, so there's no cheating!)
