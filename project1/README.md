### 9:30 - 10:45 a.m.

**Project #1**

* Let's start by looking at some key components of any programming language - variables, strings, integers and comparisons. We'll consider Python lists and we'll work toward using a couple core libraries - ```urllib``` and ```csv```  - to download a csv file and read the contents.

**The files**

```step_1.py``` and ```step_1_complete.py```

* What's a string? What's an integer? What's a list? Nevermind that, what's a Python?
    * What can we do to find out what something is?
        * We can try to get its type
        * We can try to get its length
    * Let's learn more about things we can do with strings
        * capitalize it
        * lowercase it
        * uppercase it
    * Let's do some math
        * multiplication
        * division
        * addition
        * subtraction
        * order of operations

```step_2.py``` and ```my_step_2.py```

* Download a csv file, open it and print out the data to our terminal/command line

```step_3.py``` and ```my_step_3.py```

* Let's use a FOR loop to log each row, noting the data type & the contents.

```step_4.py``` and ```my_step_4.py```

* Let's get the header row, learn about list indexes and strings and getting lengths.

```step_5.py``` and ```my_step_5.py```

```step_6.py``` and ```my_step_6.py```

* Let's keep using the header row to learn more things that we can do with strings
    * get a specfic item from a list by it's index
    * evaluate values
    * remove a character between two words
    * change a character to an underscore
    * strip whitespace
    * split two words on a character
    * get its type
    * use the length of the list and lowercase the two strings we created to create a sentence

```step_7.py``` and ```my_step_7.py```
