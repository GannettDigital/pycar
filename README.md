##Python mini boot camp at #NICAR16 in Denver

Today, we'll use the iPython interactive interpreter to explore Python. At the end of the day, we'll give you all of the code from the exercises, along with several cheatsheets and tutorials, to take home with you, all from the class' code repository on Github.

###Schedule for the day
####[Introduction](https://ireapps.github.io/pycar/pycar_intro.html)

* Who are you, what do you do, what do you want to learn?
* What will we learn?
* What can I do with it?
* The goal of the day is to start to learn how to think about solving problems.

####[The Basics](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/basics)
We'll introduce some key Python types like the interactive interpreter, strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.

####[Project #1](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/project1)
As with many data analyses, it all starts with a CSV. After a white board exercise, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through writing the program in Python code, running the file at the command line. We'll hold your hand through each step of the process.

LUNCH ON YOUR OWN

####How to debug your code, aka "Google and StackOverflow are your new best friends"

####[Project #2](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/project2)
We have a CSV of baseball player salaries. Let's figure out who makes the most money and examine some other biographical information about them, using dictionaries.

####[Project #3](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/project3)
This section covers gathering data from the web in two common formats. 
In the first part, we'll scrape structured data from an html page using a GET request and writing the data to a CSV. In the second part, we'll request data from an API to get information programatically to create a spreadsheet. Our data comes in a new format: JSON. We'll do some more with the white board to show how it's basically a combination of data structures we already know about: Lists and dictionaries (arrays and objects).

At the end of the day, we'll __[send you home with](takehome/README.md)__:

* A [lightning dash](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/PyCAR_basics) through basic variables, types and functions
* The [working, commented code](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/completed) for each project from our git repo
* A walkthrough for setting up your machine at home with Python, version control and virtualenvs
* Good libraries to explore with strong tutorials
* A lifetime support guarantee [from us](CONTRIBUTORS.md) & [PythonJournos](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonJournos)
