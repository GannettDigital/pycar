#PyCAR14
##Python mini boot camp at #NICAR14 in Baltimore

Let's use [Wakari.io](http://www.wakari.io/) bundles for teaching this class. At the end, we'll give you everything working in Github.

As a backup plan in case the internet is bad, we can have the bundles on the machines, and we can use the [Anaconda distro of Python](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)'s interactive interpreter through Windows PowerShell.

###Schedule for the day
9 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. [Introduction](http://bit.ly/intropycar14) **[TOM]**
Quick intros:
Who are you, what do you do, what do you want to learn?
What will we learn:
what can i do with it?

The goal of the day is to start to learn how to think about solving problems.



9:30 - 10:30 a.m.
Project #1 **[CHRIS K]**
Start with a CSV. What do we want to do with it?
Let's white board it.
Start with parsing and processing exercise, introducing key Python types and concepts, like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.

After the white board, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through together writing in Python code, running the file at the command line.
We'll hold your hand through it, step by step. (Only at the end of the day will we give you the full working version, so there's no cheating!)

10:45 - 12:15 p.m.
Project #2 **[HEATHER and RYAN]**
Let's do some processing to a whole folder full of CSVs, bringing in more loops, I/O and dictionaries.

LUNCH - 12:15 - 1

1 - 1:30 - How to debug your code, aka "Google and StackOverflow are your new best friends" **[HEATHER]**

1:30 - 3 p.m. **[TOM and ERIC]**
Project #3
Let's scrape a website and put the contents into a CSV.
In the afternoon, try to scrape a website.

3:15 - 4:50 p.m.
Project #4 **[CHRIS K and KEVIN]**
Scrape many websites and merge them together
_or_
python for converting all your data: json, xml, excel into one big csv!


At the end of the day, we'll send you home with:

* the working code and ipython notebooks for each project from our git repo
* cookbook of heavily commented recipes for common data tasks
* a list of common projects you might want to tackle with python
* a walkthrough for setting up your machine at home.
* Good libraries to explore with strong tutorials
* version control and virtual envs
* lifetime support guarantee from us & PythonJournos
