##Python mini boot camp at #NICAR14 in Baltimore

Let's use [Wakari.io](http://www.wakari.io/) bundles for this class. At the end, we'll give you everything working in Github.

As a backup plan in case the internet is bad, we'll have the bundles on the machines, and we can use the [Anaconda distro of Python](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)'s interactive interpreter in Windows PowerShell.

###Schedule for the day
9 a.m. - 9:15 a.m. [Introduction](http://bit.ly/intropycar14)

* Who are you, what do you do, what do you want to learn?
* What will we learn:
* what can i do with it?
* The goal of the day is to start to learn how to think about solving problems.

9:20 - 10:30 a.m.
Project #1
Start with a CSV. Let's write some basic scripts to see what we're working with. Then we'll introduce some key Python types like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops.
After a white board exercise, we'll start with a file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through writing the program in Python code, running the file at the command line.
We'll hold your hand through it, step by step.

10:40 - 12:15 p.m.
Project #2
We have a CSV of baseball player salaries. Let's figure out who makes the most money and examine some other biographical information about them, using dictionaries.

LUNCH - 12:15 - 1

1 - 1:30 - How to debug your code, aka "Google and StackOverflow are your new best friends"

1:30 - 3 p.m.
Project #3
This section covers webscraping with Python using a get request, writing the data to a CSV.

3:15 - 4:50 p.m.
Project #4
Let's use an API to get information programatically to create a spreadsheet. Our data comes in a new format: JSON. Show on the whiteboard how it's basically a combination of data structures we already know about: Lists and dicts (arrays and objects).


At the end of the day, we'll send you home with:

* A [lightning dash](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/pycar14) through basic variables, types and functions.
* the working, commented code for each project from our git repo
* a walkthrough for setting up your machine at home.
* Good libraries to explore with strong tutorials
* version control and virtual envs
* lifetime support guarantee from us & [PythonJournos](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonJournos)
